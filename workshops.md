# Workshops <small>Current and Upcoming</small>


## Engaging Young People in Risk Assessment

This session will:

  - introduce a tool that can assist professionals in engaging young people in positively recognising and managing risk
    (for example, in offending, substance misuse, self harm, and/or relationships);
  - provide evidence and examples, with a case study, of how the tool is interactive, visual, engaging and holistic;
  - share the research and evidence that informs the toolkit to support professional judgements in assessments and planning

The session can comprise a 3 hour workshop to look at all the areas of past and current risk or protective factors, resilience and desistance.  For more detailed exploration on risk taking behaviour and the areas for support that young people can access then a one day (or two 3 hour sessions) would be better suited. A take-away tool kit with interactive cards and research material can be made available with this package. 


## Skills sharing workshops for Troubled Families projects

Tailor made workshops can be developed to promote inter-professional family work. Ideal for teams that have teams with professionals from both youth work and early years parenting disciplines.

The facilitator draws on experience from:

  - working in London Youth Offending Teams as a case manager, parenting worker and senior practitioner
  - managing an Early Years outreach parenting service
  - establishing a Family Intervention Project
  - a professional doctorate in youth justice with a focus on parenting / family work and crime prevention
  - social work in New Zealand services with an ethos of encouraging the whole family unit to change, develop and take responsibility 
  - delivering training to practitioners on attachment, childhood development, assessment, risk management and more
