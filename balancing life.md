# Balancing on the Tightrope of Life <small>workbook to increase resilience</small>

This workbook is an amalgamation of my original tightrope tools and my life experience as a working mother and the techniques I have learnt in my journey towards becoming a coach. 

The workbook provides an introduction to the Tightrope analogy and to Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as Tapping) 

You are invited to work through each section of the Tightrope to uncover...
- what behaviours mean that you're "falling off"
- what qualities and strengths you have to stay balanced
- the areas of past harm that mean the ground under the tightrope is muddy and therefore makes the tightrope more wobbly
- the past positive experiences that can help create a more stable tightrope
- what stressors and fears are making the tightrope higher
- who or what is your safety net
- the values that support your decisions and actions
- the steps you can take to create more balance
- the ultimate goals you want to achieve in your family, work/education, friendship and for yourself
