# About Vlinder

Vlinder is the service delivered by [Dr Roberta Evans][profile], who is a qualified social worker with over 20 years experience in practice. Roberta has a doctorate in youth justice and parenting. Since 2021 Roberta became one of Brittany Watkins Tapping for Weightloss Coaches and has a keen interest in unravelling the impact of past childhood trauma to enable and empower positive change toward fulfilling adult futures. 

Vlinder means butterfly in dutch (Roberta's ancestoral origin) and is an alliteration of Roberta's maiden name (Vlugter). The butterfly logo and figure surrounded by butterflies were created by her son (aged 10).
