## Publications

["Parenting Orders: The Parents Attend Yet the Kids Still Offend"][parenting-orders], Youth Justice 2012 12: 118, August 2012

This article draws from a wider thesis completed at Bedfordshire University (Vlugter, 2009 'Too Little, Too Late: Parenting Orders as a form of crime prevention'). It presents results from an empirical case study and examines the circumstances of parents attending programmes, their attendance and the young people’s recorded offending before and after the intervention, considering the type of intervention and number of sessions attended. 

["Balancing positive engagement and transparent risk analysis with volatile youth: Introducing the Tightrope Tool"][Introducing Tightrope], Howard League What is Justice? Working Papers 18/2015 

This paper presents a tool that encourages the engagement of the young person in the analysis of their risks, strengths and needs and in the planning of actions based on a balanced and transparent holistic assessment. It will introduce the analogy of the Tightrope, outline how it fits with current assessment frameworks to support an integrated approach and considers the role of the practitioner to apply a person-centred, strength-based approach with the tool. This paper will outline why an integrated and interactive holistic tool for volatile youth would be of benefit to both young people and professionals from various disciplines and concludes with an invitation to experienced practitioners to trial the tool in wider practice.
