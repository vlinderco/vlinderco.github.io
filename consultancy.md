## Publications

["Parenting Orders: The Parents Attend Yet the Kids Still Offend"][parenting-orders], Youth Justice 2012 12: 118, August 2012

This article draws from a wider thesis completed at Bedfordshire University (Vlugter, 2009 'Too Little, Too Late: Parenting Orders as a form of crime prevention'). It presents results from an empirical case study and examines the circumstances of parents attending programmes, their attendance and the young people’s recorded offending before and after the intervention, considering the type of intervention and number of sessions attended.
