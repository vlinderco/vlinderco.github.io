Want to engage young people in open discussions about their circumstances and future goals?

Regardless of a young person’s presenting needs this toolkit offers a holistic approach in social work, youth offending, substance misuse work, mental health or wellbeing support.

Supporting current approaches of trauma informed practice, Signs of Safety®, GoodLives, Desistance Theory and Motivational Interviewing the toolkit is based on an analogy that being a teenager can be like walking on a Tightrope and supports an open discussion to reflect on key areas within assessments and plans:

-	Falling Off – the behavior we are worried might happen in the future
-	Safety Net – those who support and help now
-	Steps up  – current worries or complicating factors making the risk higher
-	Balancing Strengths – individual strengths to help manage the situation
-	Muddy Path – experiences in the past that makes things volatile now
-	Foundations – times of success and exceptions to harm
-	Central values – the intentions and motives of past or future behaviour
-	Steps Down – actions needed / planning for future goals and safe ground
